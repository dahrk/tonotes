## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite for robust data persistence with the following structure:

- `notes`: Core note data (content, position, size, timestamps, color themes)
- `tags`: Tag definitions with normalized names and metadata
- `note_tags`: Many-to-many relationship between notes and tags with referential integrity

## Development

### Code Style

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use functional React components
- Implement proper type definitions
- Follow the existing project structure

### Building for Production

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build:all
   ```

2. Create macOS distributable packages:
   ```bash
   npm run dist:mac
   ```
   This creates both DMG and ZIP files for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

3. Create distributable packages for all platforms:
   ```bash
   npm run dist:all
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Notes not saving properly**
- Check that the app has write permissions to the user data directory
- Restart the application if auto-save appears stuck
- Manual save with `Cmd/Ctrl+S` should always work

**System tray icon not visible**
- On macOS, check System Preferences > Dock & Menu Bar > Clock
- If using dark mode, the icon may be less visible - look for the bullet (‚óè) indicator
- Right-click in the system tray area to access the context menu

**Notes not staying on top**
- Use `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+A` to toggle always-on-top behavior
- Check Settings window for always-on-top preferences
- On macOS, ensure the app has accessibility permissions if needed

**Performance issues with many notes**
- Consider archiving old notes by deleting unused ones
- Global search is optimized but may be slower with 100+ notes
- Close unused note windows to reduce memory usage

**Build or installation issues**
- Ensure Node.js version 16+ is installed
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- For macOS builds, ensure Xcode command line tools are installed

### System Requirements

- **macOS**: 10.14 Mojave or later (Intel and Apple Silicon supported)
- **Windows**: Windows 10 version 1809 or later
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 18.04, Fedora 28, or equivalent
- **Memory**: 200MB RAM minimum, 500MB recommended
- **Storage**: 150MB for application and user data

### Known Limitations

- Maximum of ~1000 notes for optimal performance
- Note content size limit of 1MB per note
- System tray behavior varies by operating system
- Shortcuts only work when note windows are focused (by design to prevent conflicts)
